<p>From TED</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Convinced of the power of design to change the world, at age 26 Pilloton founded Project H to help develop effective design solutions for people who need it most.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Emily and her team give things to the poorest students, they are hope and passion. </p>

<a id="41-design-is-education" class="anchor" href="#41-design-is-education" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>4.1 Design is Education</h3>

<p>As Prof.Yang put it,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>专家级别的开发者善用设计模式</p>

<p>Translation: Excellent developers are good at design.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Right now I am learning education system with a designer perspective, this is also the reason why I love this TED talk. 
<strong>Designing Model</strong> does help, cause it can put yourself in other's position. Thinking from a designer view, you'll learn things in depth, in addition, you'll keep it for a life long time. 
Next time when you fall in love with sth, be sure to get involved in it, and keep doing exercise while you are studying(练中学). </p>

<p>Why what happens after the training is as important as the training itself? According to a business white paper by Kevin Lovell^1, what really matters is the response after training.</p>

<blockquote>
<h4>
<a id="reason1" class="anchor" href="#reason1" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Reason#1</h4>

<p>13% of learners don’t use what they learn, don’t experience performance improvement and also lack line manager support.</p>

<h4>
<a id="reason2" class="anchor" href="#reason2" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Reason#2</h4>

<p>Around 10% of learners receive training that is ill-suited to their needs.</p>

<h4>
<a id="reason3" class="anchor" href="#reason3" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Reason#3:</h4>

<p>Around 5% of learners don’t use what they learned because of bad timing.</p>

<h4>
<a id="reason4" class="anchor" href="#reason4" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Reason#4:</h4>

<p>Around 3% of learners complete training, knowing they will not use what they learn.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Just take an example of learning English by most Chinese students. We started to learn English since the primary school, we've spent nearly 15 years on it. However, when it comes to speaking English or writing in English, we still feel embarrassed. 
Why? I think the reason lies in the education system, we learned so much of useless knowledge, but ill-suited to our needs. When we got a red-colored score, say 59, that's the time we finally realize the learning outcome, still bad timing and ill-suited.</p>

<h2>
<a id="5-what-are-the-lessons" class="anchor" href="#5-what-are-the-lessons" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>5 What are the lessons?</h2>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Ensure training is properly targeted</strong> 
Not too hard, not too easy, but teaching students the life-long knowledge, such as <em>self-learning, designing perspective.</em>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Teachers need to support learners after training</strong>
Making positive response, let students be proud of their work.</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Capture post training data</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The best training course in the world is worthless unless learners subsequently use what they learn – so you need to know what happens after they go back to the workplace.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For instance, the last 5 minutes of class is the best time to review newly-get knowledge.</p>
